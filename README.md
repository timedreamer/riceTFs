## README

This is the repo for analyzing rice TF RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq for [ConnecTF-Rice](https://rice.connectf.org/).

Carly found all the rice TFs with RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data. Carly and Ji processed RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data from scratch for TFs that don't have gene lists available. The pipelines are in the `src` directory.

All data have been uploaded to [ConnecTF-Rice](https://rice.connectf.org/).
